# Hello!
I want to leave here few notes on things that should've been changed in this solution but weren't because of one reason or another.
- Types should've been improved/added, e.g error in `HttpClient` or 
```typescript
data as any
```
in `ininitialState` of `Energy.tsx`
- Naming should've been improved, e.g for 'IGas'
- `Energy.tsx` should be refactored to a hook.
- Should test `Energy.tsx` in terms of rendering `Chart` if data exists.
- Could add some loading bar when loading the data
- Could add `sanitize.css` or smth similar.

# Instructions how to start and test
>`npm start`

>`npm run test`

#### Feedback
It was actually nice to complete tech task that is about how you solve the problem rather than just complexity of the problem given. I'm looking forward to hearing from you!
